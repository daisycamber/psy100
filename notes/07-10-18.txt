topics:
-neurotransmitters
-lobes of the brain
-structures of the brain
-nervous system
-endoocrine system

neurotransmitters carry information across the synaptic gap to the next neuron
-acetylcholine
-muscle actions, learning, memory
-black widow venom raises levels
-botox lowers levels (of ach)
-alzheimers is a lowering of ach

history of alzheimers disease
-1901 first case in germany
-death and autopsy in germany
-beta amyloid & tau protein identified 80s
-first alzheimers drug trial and approved by the fda 80s-90s

basic characteristics and symptoms
-first signs typically associated with memory problems
-other first signs issues with word finding, vision spatial issues, impaired feasining and jusgement
-mild alzheimers disease, greater memory loss, getting lost, most often diagnosed in this stage
-moderate alzheimers disease further generation of the brain
-severe alzheimers disease, plaques and rangles increase thruought the brain (eventually ends in complete body shutdown and the sweet sweet release of 
death)

GABA = gamma-aminobutyric acid
-anxiety lowers gaba levels

though phobias may make certain aspects of life more difficult, people tend to change their lives to avoid their phobias (consdidered a form of 
anxiety) 

glutamate
-excitatory
-learning and memory
-involved in many psychoological disorders

norepenephrine
-stress and mania raises norepinephrine levels
-depression lowers norepineophrine levels

GABA/glutamate medications are related to seizure kind of medications

dopamine
-voluntary movement
-reward anticipation
-stimulate drugs activates dopamine receptors
-parkinsons disease lowers dopamine levels

serotonin
-regulation of sleep, mood, attention, and learning
-depression lowers serotonin levels
-prozac raises serotonin levels
-zoloft works by keeping seroptonin in the synapse longer, giving it more time to exert an effect

endorphins
-natural opiates
-mediate feelings of pleasure and pain
-eg adrenaline/epinephrine (synthetic adrenaline)

heroin causes users to feel rush of pleasure and then numbness caused by endorphins

cause of depression is unknown, but it is thought to be related to a neurochemical imbalance in the brain, even young children can suffer from 
depression, anxiety and schizophrenia

the cns (central nervous system) and the pns (peripheral nervous system) are the two major parts of the nervous system.

narcan is a drug that blocks receptors of opiates and prevents/mitigates overdose, many people have it from school nurses to librarians, saved my life 
too many times

exam on this friday 7-13
sensation, four lobes of brain, major structures
wednesday/thursday talking about sensation and perception
make sure to study, do homweork before friday for exam.
