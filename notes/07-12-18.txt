myth - the right and left side of the brain are responsible for logic and creativity
the left and the right do control different body function
right side controls left arm and leg, vice versa
each eye has a left and right visual field, both eyes send to left and right brain

there is no research suggesting individuals have dominant sides of the brain.
sensations are environmental stimuli, understanding is perception
sennsation is the process of recieving stimulus energies from the external environment
perception is the p0rocess of organizing and interpreting sensory information

areas of focus for exam:
-definition of psychology
-nature vs nurture
-historical figures
-people of significance
-approaches to psychology
-research design
-descriptive methods
-experimental theory
-correlation
-parts of a neuron
-action potential
-lobes of brain
-cns pns
-endocrine system
-experiments (control/experiment group, independant/dependant variable)
-structures of brain
-thalymus,
-amygala
-hippocampus
-hypothalamus
-cerebellum
-pons
-medula
-right/left
-broca's/wernicke's (language,left)
-right/left hemisphere
-contralaterization left->right right->left

sensation v perception
sensation and perception are often used synonymously but are distinct
sensation is passive, perception is passive.
sensation absorbs energy while perception organizes energy
perception discriminates between interferance and relevant input, and is a function of past experiences, culture, etc

-photoreception is detection of ligght
-mechanoreception is touch, pressure, vibe, movement
-chemoreception (smell and taste), detection of chemical stimuli

-absolute threshold is the minimum amount of energy an organism can detect 50% of the time
how much stimulus change is neccesay for detection?
-JND Just Noticeable Difference (JND)
-JND increases with stimulus magnitude

short answer areas
-apa
-synesthesia
-types of psychologist/workplace
-visual illusions

Sensory adaption
-change in responsiveness of sensory system
-based on level of surrounding stimulation (darkened room, bright outdoors)

properties of light
-wavelength=distance between peaks
-percieved as hue
-some wavelengths beyond human sensation

vision
-most of the eye is blind, in the center cones collect sharp colours

retina:
photo-receptor cells 
-rods are sensitive to even dim light, not color, function well in low light, humans have ~120 million
-cones respond to colour, coperate best under high illumination, humans have ~6 million cones

fovea - densley populated with cones vital to many visual tasks

trichomatic theory, color vision theory that states we have three cone types rgb, other colors in combination, and other colors 

inability to perceive colors, total color blindness is rare
color weakness is more common, makes it more difficult to identify colours

wavelength is the distance between peaks, determines frequency, perceived as pitch

outer ear acts as funnel to direct sound, pinna is internal part of the ear

pathway of audotiry information cochlea to auditory nerve

olfactory recetprs are the hairlike parts that extend from the olfacctory bulb into the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity
