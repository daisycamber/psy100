experimental design can show cause and effect using independant and dependant variables, experimental and control group 

for exam:
-identify and know parts of a neuron

peripheral nervous system is divided into somatic, voluntary and autonomic, involuntary nervous system. atonomic is divided into sympathetic which 
arouses body to expend energy and parasympathetic which calmos body to conserve and maintain energy.
the cns is divided into brain and spinal cord, the spinal cord connecting the brain to the peripheral nervous system.

part of anxiety is due to overactive autonomic particularly sympathetic nervous system. panic disorder causes us to become alarmed because of 
something around us

much of treating anxiety is changing and restructuring thoughts about what you are feeling and gaining control, because often times we feel out of 
control.

the corpus collosum seperates the left and right side of the brain, allowing them to communicate with each other. overcommunicating brains can cause 
siezure disorder. most recently the protocal for this disorder is medications based on cbd for individuals with siezure disorder,
for some people severing the corpus collosum was an effective treatment for siezure disorder originally 

the overall organization of the brain
-contralateral control: for many functions such as sensory processing and motor control, major pathway between left and right
-three major sections of the brain
-forebrain - uppermost and largest brain region
-cerebral cortex, divided into two hemispheres and responsible for major cognitive functions 
-connected by corpus collosum
-midbrain contains structures involved in processing visual and auditory information
-hindbrain is the region at the base of the brain that connects the brain to the spinal cord

frontal lobe is largest lobe, involved in thinking planning emotional control
role in motor control/primary motor cortext involved in planning, initiating voluntary movements

Lobes of the cortex
-frontal lobe largest lobe produces voluntary muscle movements, involved in thinking, planning, emotional control, higher mental func
-temporal lobe primary receiving area for auditory information and language centers
-occipital lobe, primary recieving area for visual information
-parietal lobe processes somatic information, body sensations such as touch, pain, temperature

forebrain structures
-thalamus
-limbic system
-cortex
thalamus processes all sensory information except for sense of smell. 
hypothalamus links brain and endocrine system, regulates hunger, thirst, sleep, sexual behavour
thalamus processes and integrates sensory informationm relays sensory info to cerebral cortex
amygdala is involved in memory and emotion, esp fear and anger meaning damage can cause loss of facial recognition and emotional recognition
hippocampus is involved in forming new memories
cerebellum
-coordinated, rapid voluntary movements, lesions cause loss in coordination
-brain stem includes medula, recticular formation and pons

no memory (video)
-memory effects life more than we realize

brocas area and brocas aphasia
-1860s discovered by french surgeon and neuroanatomist pierre paul broca
-broca treated a series of patients who had difficulty speaking but could comprehend written or spoken language
-due to brain damage to an area on the lower left now referred to as brocas area, crucial role in speech production.

german neurologist karl wernicke discovered area in the left hemispherer that when damaged produced great difficulty understanding spoken or written 
communications 
patients could speak quickly and easily 
however their speech sometimes made now sense

The endocrine system - glands communicatye information from one part of the body to another by secreting messenger chemicals called hormones into the 
bloodstream
pineal gland produces mellatonin, regulates sleep wake
thyroid gland controls body metabolism rate
adrenal glands produce epinephrine which cause physical aarousal in response to danger, fear, anger, stress and other strong emotions
pancreas regulates blood sugar and insulin levels, involved in hunger
ovaries secrete estrogen and progesterone, regulate sexual development behaviour and reproduction
testes secrete testosterone, regulates male sexual development reproduction and behaviour

studying the brain
-brain lesioning naturally occurring or induced
-electrical recording
