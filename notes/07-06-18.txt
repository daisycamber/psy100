positive psych is the child of human mystic psychology. idea is to look at resiliency of people, how they maintain happiness, maintain moving forward 
in uplifting and positive manner, and how we can bounce back if we have challenges in ouir life.

Martin Seligman spent his life work at the university of Penn

Goals of psychology:
to
-describe
-explain
-predict (much interest in behavour predicting)
-control (as in control the experiment, not mind control)
behaviour and mental processes.

many active shooters take their own life

Scientific method
-observe some phenomenon
-predict

theory
-tenative explanation for observed findings
-results from accumulation of findings of individual studies
-tool for explaining observed behavior
-reflects self correcting nature of scientific method

research strategies
-descriptive strategies for observing and describing behavior, naturalistic observation, surveys and interviews, case studies, correlational methods
-experimental strategies for inferring cause and effect relationships among variables

definitions
-hypothesis - testable prediction that derives logically from a theory

naturalistic observvation
-researchers directly observe and record behavior raatherthan relying on subject descriptions. in naturalistic observation researcher records behavior 
as it occurs naturally

survey methods and interviews:
-designed to investigate opinions, behaviours, or characteristics of a particular group. usually in self report form.

correlationnal study
-collects a set of facts organized into two or more categories
-measure  parents disciplinary style, childrens behaviour
-examine the relationships between categories
-correlation reveals relationships among facts, eg more democratic parents have children who behave better

samples and sampling
-population - large (potentially infinite) group represented by the sample.n findings are generalized to this group
-sample - selected segment of the population
-representative sample - closely parallels the population on relevant characteristics
-random sample - every member of larger group has equal change of being selected for the study sample.

cant survey the whole world, instead take a piece of the world in this experiment. 

coefficient of correlation
-numerical indication of magnitude and direction between the relationship of two variables
-positive correlation
- two variables vary systematically in the same direction
-negative correlation
- two variables vary systematically in opposite directions

experiments
-direct way to test a hypothesis about a cause-effect relationship between factors
- factors are called variables
- one vari8able is controlled by the experimenter-independent variable
-e.g. democratic vs authoritarian classroom
- the other is observed and measured- dependant variable, e.g. cooperative behavior among students.

experimental variables:
-iv is controlled
-dv is measured, hypothesized to be influenced by iv
