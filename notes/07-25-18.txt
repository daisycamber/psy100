Learning: some key terms
learning - relativley permanent change in behavior due to experierncee
-does not include temporary changes due to disease, injury, maturation, or drugs, since these do not quaaliy as learning
reinforcement is any event that increases the probability that a response will recur.
reinforcement always increases some type of behaviour.

learning theory
learning is a systematic, relativley permanent change in behaviour that occurs through experience
behaviouralism
associative learning/conditioning
observational learning

classical conditioning and ivan pavlov
russian physiologist who initially was studying digestion
used togs to study salivation when dogs were presented with meat powder
also known a s pavlovian or respondent conditioning
classic and operant conditioning


neutral stimulus doesnt elicit a response but will eventually because of classical conditioning, an association

nerural stimulus = ringing bell, unconditional stimulus is food
rang the bell while giving the dogs food to encourage them to salivate (the unconditional response)

distinction between condition response is now known as extinction
when this behaviour returned even after they werent conditioned this was called spontaneous recovery
stimulus discrimination (being able to differentiate between different stimuli)

through stimulus generalization, little albert came to fear furry thangs, including watson in a santa claus mask

reinforcement increases, punishment decreases behaviour.
punishment can go really wrong if it is done improperly, should be paired with some reinforcement (some positive reinforcement)

operant conditioning terms
positive reinforcement - when a response is followed by a reward or other positive event
negative reinforcmeent - whuen a response is foillowed by the removal of an unpleasant event, eg thebells in fannies car stop when she puts the 
seatbelt on ) or by an end to discomfort
punishment is any event that follows a response and decreases the likelihood of it recurring (e.g. a slap)

reinforcement increases behaviour

primary reinforcers
-innately satisfying
-nonlearned and natural; satisfies biological needs (e.g., food, water, sex)

secondary reinforcers
-become satisfying through experience
-repeated associating with a pre-existing reinforcer
