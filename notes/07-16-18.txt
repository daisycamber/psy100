Altered states of conciousness:
-drug states
-fatigue, illness, trauma, deprivation
-meditation, hypnosis

cortisol levels rise in morning, triggering hunger

levels of awareness

-subconcious awareness, incubation, parralell processing
-sleep and dreams, low levels of conciousness of outside world
-no awareness unconcious censored thought, non-concious process

biological rhythms
-periodic physiological fluctuations
1. annual or seasonal
2. 24 hour cycles = circadian rhythms

-monitored by suprichasmatic nucleus
-controlled by biological clocks

melatonin levels rise with lack of sun.

The suprachismatic nucleus- the bodys clock
(SCN is a cluster of neurons in the hypothalamus that governs the timing of circadian rhythms)
(Melatonin - hormone of the pineal gland that produces sleepiness)
Environmental Cues for Circadian Rhythm
-bright light, especially sunlight, helps regulate sleep-wake cycle and other circadian rhythms.
-light detected by special photoreceptors signals the scn in the hypothalamus.

why do we need sleep?
for  adaptive evolutionary function, saftey and energy conservation/efficiency, as well as restorative function, body rejuvenation and growth, and 
brain plasticity, enhances synapptic connections and memory consolidation.

part of dreaming is the things that arer happening in our lives, what the brain is processing, but that part of the brain is not concious, the body 
shuts down and the braia creates the storyline without it.

brainwave activity changes dramatically across the different stages of sleep. 
-awake
-stage 1 nrem alpha
-stage 2 nrem theta(sleep spindles, K-complexes)
-stage 3 and 4 nrem delta
-REM, fast active brain waves accompanied by rapid eye movements (REMs)

people can sleep walk and talk in REM, called RBD rem behaviour 
disoroder

awake and alert, beta brain waves.
awake and drowsy; alpha brain waves.
stage 1 NREM sleep; mixture of alpha and theta brain waves
