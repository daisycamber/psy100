chapter 3: biopsychology
biological prespective/approach
parts of  a neuron -
neutotransmitters - types disorders
division of nervious system
lobes of the brain

structures of brain
left/right hemispherer

brain imaging
- x ray
- ct scan
- mostly using MRI/FMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging
- pet scan, blood flow and electrical activity happening in brain

neuroscientists want to see how the brain is working on all levels

enlarged ventricles (where the spinal fluid empties into) means gray matter is shrinking, may account for some behaviours we see in people with 
schizophrenia
people can live normal full lives with schizophrenia if they are properly treated, though they often have a higher rate of suicide

- news depicts people in news of shootings as being mentally ill, though schizophrenics are more likely to commit suicide than homocide. between 
10-15% of schizophrenics commit suicide.

trillions of neurons, though no two touch each other though they activley communicate.

parts of a neuron:

1-cell membrane
2-dendrite
3-cell body
4-axon
5-myelin sheath
6-terminal buttons

axons connect to dendrites, sending chemical signals

impulse travels through mylein sheath

Neuron and its Parts

neuron - individual nerve cell handles the information processing function
-dendrites receive messages from other neurons
-soma is the cell body of the neuron
-axon is the fibre that carries information away from the cell body
-axon terminals are branches that link the dendrites and somas of other neuron myekub fatty layer of tissue that cooats axons
-multiple sclerosis occurs when myelin layer is destroyed, numbness weakness and paralysis occur

neuron is individual nerve cell, deendrites receive messages from other neurons

mylein sheath
-white fatty casing on axon
-acts as an electrical insulator
- not present in all cells

neuron to neuron communication
-axons brtanch out and end near dendrites of neighgbor cells
-axon terminals are the tips of axons branches
-a gap seperates the axon terminals from dendrites
-gap is the synapse
neuron works on all or none principal

the synapse is the space between the terminal of one neuron and the dendrite of another neuron

SSRIs are Selective Seretonin Reuptake Inhibitor
SSRNIs N=norepenephrine

How neurons communicate
-by mneans of electrical signal called the action potential
-action potentials are based on movements of ions between neurons with negative and positive potential charge,  usually positie charge on outside and 
negative charge on the inside, and ions start to flow.
