division of nervious system
lobes of the brain

structures of brain
left/right hemispherer

brain imaging
- x ray
- ct scan
- mostly using MRI/FMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging
- pet scan, blood flow and electrical activity happening in brain

neuroscientists want to see how the brain is working on all levels

enlarged ventricles (where the spinal fluid empties into) means gray matter is shrinking, may account for some behaviours we see in people with

people can live normal full lives with schizophrenia if they are properly treated, though they often have a higher rate of suicide

- news depicts people in news of shootings as being mentally ill, though schizophrenics are more likely to commit suicide than homocide. between 
10-15% of schizophrenics commit suicide.

trillions of neurons, though no two touch each other though they activley communicate.

1-cell membrane
2-dendrite
3-cell body
4-axon
5-myelin sheath
6-terminal buttons
